# screeps

A Leiningen template for creating a project for screeps.

## Usage

If you want to deploy your changes to screeps, you need to export SCREEPS_USERNAME, SCREEPS_PASSWORD (and optionally SCREEPS_BRANCH) in your environment before running this command.

```
./scripts/watch
```

I recommend making a test branch and deploying to that and setting the sim to use that branch.
